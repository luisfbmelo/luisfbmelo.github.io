A project developed by four friends, the "Sismo d’Oitenta" website was developed to archive the testimonies and stories of survivors who experienced the 1 January 1980 Azores earthquake that destoyed the historic centre of Angra do Heroísmo, and affected the islands of Terceira, São Jorge and Graciosa. 

The platform provides interesting techniques to promote understanding of the event, including photo comparisons, victim testimonies and eyewitness accounts.
