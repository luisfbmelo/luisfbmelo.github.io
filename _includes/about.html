            <h3>Lu√≠s Melo</h3>
            <h4>UX/UI Design, Web Development & Photography</h4>
            <p>  
              I am a Portuguese UX/UI designer and front-end developer, with experience in backend development, confident in creating useful, clean and user-centeric web and mobile experiences.<br/>
              Similarly, I have experience implementing UX strategies, web and mobile standards, in addition to usability rules, in order to make applications and websites useful, goal-oriented and usable.
            </p>
            <p>
              When not coding or designing, then I am probably hiking or geocaching: I really enjoy nature, its sense of freedom and its limitless possibilities. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As an amateur landscape photographer, I see and recognize this interconnected complexity and, as a coder, I perceive the underlying simplicity and harmony.
