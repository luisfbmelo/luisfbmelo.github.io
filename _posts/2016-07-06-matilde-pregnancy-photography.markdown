<p class="text-center" markdown="1">
Last Sunday was an amazing day, I had the oportunity to photograph one of the most important events of my two friends' life. Matilde is her name, and has about three more months in her mother's belly. This was the first oportunity that I had to photograph a couple that is awaiting for their child, and since they are two amazing friends, it was a lot easier to interact and much more enjoyable.
