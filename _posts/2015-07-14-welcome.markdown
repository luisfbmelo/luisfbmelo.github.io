<p class="text-center">Hello! Welcome to my fresh and new website!</p>

<!--more-->
![Welcome!](/images/blog/2015-07-14-welcome/welcome.jpg)
Finally, the old website goes out and here comes the new one. This time, all content is responsive and easily accessible. It has been a long journey since the last time I developed the first version, I mean, three years ago. A lot has changed, technology evolved and so did design. It is extremely important to keep up with this evolution and make our work even better.

It is time to start from zero, and what I intend to do is to, not only share my work, but also some of my knowledge that can, somehow, help you in the future. Or better yet, I will learn from your experiences also. All contributions are welcome, since this is why we are here in this world. The world isn't me, it's us.

This section will be like a conversation in a coffe shop, where I will share the my design and development processes and some possible solutions that I find that work for me, and probably for you too.

With this, I invite you to start following my website and comment as you wish, contributing to the community.

Oh, and feel free to share if you like :)
