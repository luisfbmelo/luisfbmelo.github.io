<p class="text-center">Hello! Welcome to my fresh and new website!</p>

<!--more-->
![Welcome!](/images/blog/2015-07-14-welcome/welcome.jpg)

Out with the old, and in with the new! It has been a long journey, since I first developed my website, three years ago. A lot has changed, technology has evolved and, so too, has design. It is very important to keep up with the "industry", its recent trends and to evolve accordingly.

So, it is time to start from scratch. A version 2.0. This website is both responsive and easily accessible. The site will allow me to, not only, share my work and knowledge, but also assist you in the future. And I also intend to learn from your experiences, so all contributions are invited and welcome.  

This will be my "coffee shop": a place to visit, share my design and development strategies, discover solutions and receive feedback from other like-minded users. I invite you to follow my website, comment and contribute to my online community. 

Oh, and feel free to share if you wish :smirk:
